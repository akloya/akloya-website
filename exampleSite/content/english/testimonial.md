  designation : "Chief Information Officer, Akeso Medical Holdings LLC"
  content : "Ajaya is an incredibly talented Dev Ops professional - so much, in fact, that I continued to rely on him after CLARA Analytics span off from LeanTaaS (and he maintained a great attitude - even when he didn't have to anymore). He is an expert at his field, and easy to work with. His peers clearly respect him and enjoy his presence - and leadership has the utmost confidence in him. I watched him mentor members of my team and our transition into stand-along entity was easy - and Ajaya was a major part of it.
I highly recommend him to any technology team - and hope to work with him again in the future."

He is highly skilled in building tools which have helped automate several tedious and manual processes. Ajaya also contributed tremendously in our Launch Velocity project by quickly setting up several integration environments and building appropriate monitoring and CI/CD pipelines. He is a quick learner and have applied his learning to enhance the performance across several production components. In addition to that Ajaya works extremely well with the peers and other stakeholders. Last but not least - Ajaya is a very pleasant person to work with, and his enthusiasm is quite contagious. I have no doubt that his talent and skills positions him well to succeed in future engineering roles."

  designation : "Vice President, Wells Fargo"

The Tibco BusinessWorks processes that AJ supported were extremely high value, with crucial customer service level agreements in place. AJ handled the expectations and pressures of the job with true 24x7 uptime requirements. Every scheduled maintenance request was addressed and completed without issue, and every unscheduled system or customer event was handled expertly. It is my pleasure to recommend Ajaya for any advanced Tibco technical development and support positions."

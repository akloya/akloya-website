I specialize in building reliable, secure, and scalable cloud infrastructure and scaling cloud infrastructure teams for fast-growing companies. I have several years of experience designing AWS infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, Security, and Compliance (HIPAA, SOC2).
Currently, I lead and manage infrastructure and security for LeanTaaS, a Series D healthcare tech company based in Santa Clara. My team is responsible for maintaining and evolving all the CI/CD pipelines, AWS infrastructure, Security, and Compliance. We are pushing the boundaries on building safe and scalable healthcare infrastructure using cutting-edge AWS - if you're interested in working with us, ping me. https://jobs.lever.co/leantaas
